🏗️ Testbench Architecture Overview
🔧 Core Components
🕵️ Agent - Contains Driver 🚗 + Monitor 📹 + Sequencer 📋 | Manages DUT communication for specific interfaces

🎬 Generator - Creates test scenarios & stimulus patterns | Generates transactions for DUT

📊 Scoreboard - Verifies DUT correctness ✅ | Compares expected vs actual results | Reports pass/fail status

🚗 Driver - Pushes transactions into DUT | Converts abstract transactions → actual signal transitions

📹 Monitor - Observes DUT activity | Captures output transactions | Sends data to scoreboard for checking

🎯 DUT - The actual hardware design being verified | Your SystemVerilog/Verilog module

🏢 Infrastructure
🏠 Environment - Container holding all testbench components | Configures and connects agents & scoreboards

🔌 Interface - Bundles signals together | Connects testbench to DUT ports | Contains clocks ⏰, resets 🔄, data signals

📡 IPC - TLM channels for communication | Enables transaction-based messaging between components

📚 Layered Architecture
🔄 Layer 2 - Transaction level (high-level data)

⚡ Layer - Signal level (physical pins)
