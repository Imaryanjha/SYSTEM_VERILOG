# 🧪 SystemVerilog Verification Plan Template

Welcome to the **SystemVerilog Verification Plan** repository!  
This project provides a structured and reusable template to create and manage verification plans for your SystemVerilog testbenches — whether you're working on small blocks (like a FIFO) or large SoC modules.

## 📋 What is a Verification Plan?

A **verification plan** is a document that maps your **design specifications** to corresponding **test scenarios**, **coverage goals**, and **checkpoints**.  
It ensures your verification effort is **complete**, **traceable**, and **systematic**.
